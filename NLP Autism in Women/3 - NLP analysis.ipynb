      "So I'm not a complete shut in when it comes to socialization but I can supremely enjoy my own company if i have to.   \n",
      "Other than sometimes not feeling like talking and shutting down a bit sometimes, I like talking to others a lot, and i would say im very good at it atleast 1 on 1.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After losing a friend (they ended the friendship) and not understanding why even now, and after lockdowns and drifting from 2 others i found myself reevaluating my friendships in general, these are people I've known since childhood and highschool, but i realized that because i can empathize with almost anyone i can get along great with most people if i focus, but that i didn't really have anyone that enjoyed stuff i did like i can get into there stuff but i don't get that joy that you get when you share an interest with another person and your both vibing. and i know that's not all that comes with friendship but to me its a big part of it since i like getting excited about everything and sometimes its hard to get excited about the same stuff all the time when deep down I'm not all to interested in most parts of it or have nothing to say about it and the friends were not all to interested in my stuff and don't have my ability to fake it as well lol :/ \n",
      "\n",
      "So instead of trying to resurrect the friendships i decided to just sort of move on, I'm a loyal friend so this was hard for me to do but I think i made the right choice. lockdown was perfect because it seems i was forgotten anyway so maybe they wanted to move on too. .\\_. but it was abit lonley (i have my partner and daughter who are amazing and i love spending every bit of time i have with them but i'm a friendly person that enjoys talking and while we talk a lot sometimes it can be hard because we share all the same experiences so there may be nothing much to say about something so sometimes we can talk for hours into the night and other times its just \"that was fun i liked this about it\" etc. lol   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway i only recently started talking to people again on reddit just hanging around groups that i'm interested in and eventually 2 conversations moved to private and i also put abit more effort into a friendship that i had made earlier, And i'm really happy with the people i'm talking to (surprisingly all are men since i usually get along with women a little better, and unsurprisingly at least 2 of them are on the spectrum lol), we actually share some of the same interests and they all like me talking as much as i do (which is a lot about a lot of subjects lol) which is super nice because i always felt sort of guarded with my old friends and even my dad as if they may stop caring at some point :/ also two of them happen to live within about 2 hours of me so if i ever do feel like meeting up i can which is nice cuz i like hanging out in RL sometimes! \\^\\_\\^  \n",

      "I have been involuntarily held at a juvenile psychiatric ward twice in my life. It was the same place both times, the first time for a week, and the second for a month. This post is a response to “So You’re Going to be Hospitalized Involuntarily”. Please don’t torment the writer of that one. I’m autistic, of course, so I can give my feedback on both my experience and her post. \n",
      "\n",
      "TRIGGER WARNING: Basically any graphic topic you can think of, including PTSD, forced medication, starvation, suicide, and bullying. Please excuse me, past OP of the post I’m responding to, if I’ve misinterpreted your words at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing what they said: you’re not going to like it. **They are completely right.** Let me be clear that their post, to me and many others, reads as very distant, unempathetic, condescending, apathetic, and not focused on healing at all whatsoever for whoever must go into these places. They’re probably not reflecting their feelings on the matter. They’re reflecting the system by which these facilities run. They’re *mirroring* it. They are unequivocally, undoubtedly, absolutely right in what the hospitals want. \n",
      "\n",
      "Can you prevent meltdowns? Can you attend most of the activities provided? Can you be social and put on a brave face? Can you act like a neurotypical in such a cramped, chaotic, clinical environment? Probably not. It’s outrageous to advise you to do so. It’s like telling someone to fight off their allergic reaction after forcing them to eat peanut butter. But in the psych ward, that does not matter. You do not matter. Your happiness and well being does not matter. All that matters is that you are “safe”. That’s why psych wards expect so much out of you while treating you like shit. You’re not a person, you’re a potential statistic, whether that be for homicide or suicide. You’re yet another product of the rat race that these overworked, understaffed people must fix. As long as you’re in a psych ward, **you can and may be treated less than human.** \n",
      "\n",
      "What the original OP wants for you is your mental stability to remain relatively intact and for you to be okay. That’s why their advice is summed up as: GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE ASAP, EVEN IF IT MEANS TORTURING YOURSELF TO DO SO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, even the short time spent in a psych ward is terrible. Their advice is solely short term, and it practically requires you to torture yourself for as long as you can so the staff clear you. It’s not good in the sense that it helps the core of your problems or that it allows you to maintain peace with your situation. It is, however, the best advice on how to get out of there, which is what you want. But it may not work. I’ll tell you about my experience. Again, if you’re easily upset by anything in the trigger warning above, you may want to stop now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was sixteen. My reason for being there was a suicide attempt. The other kids were of all ages--from eleven to seventeen. Most were put there for behavioral issues. Not homicidal ideation, but problems with authority, following rules, underage drinking, partying, and smoking. Everyone was miserable, and I was no exception. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were two of us per room, same-sex pairing. We were prohibited from touching one another, even in a hug or a high five. We were allowed one stuffed animal, and only one. No pens without supervision. Only immediate family could visit or call. We weren’t allowed outside. We weren’t allowed to even go to another place in that same hospital building. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was bullied by both staff and patients. One staff lady told me I was a spoiled bitch for crying. The nurse who saw me in the ER for my suicide told me I was lucky I had both parents who were still together. (By the way, I was abused at home.) The one-on-one psychiatrist appointment promised to us was a ten-second meeting with a man who asked “How are you?” followed by “Send in \\[other kid\\], please.” Because my suicide attempt was due to severe OCD, the kids bullied me. The staff were firm believers in “everyone is a bit OCD sometimes”. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was prescribed Lithium. Wanting to be compliant so I could get out quickly, I took it. The effects were disastrous. It made me so sick that I physically couldn’t get out of bed. I missed the activities. I missed the meals. The staff refused to bring me any food. I suppose they thought I was being dramatic or something. I dropped from 110 lbs to 100 lbs. That’s 11% of my total weight. All because the staff refused to let me eat in bed. My roommate brought me food, thankfully. The staff also refused to let me get an infusion of medication for my severe Crohn’s because it wasn’t in the psych ward, but rather a separate room in the hospital. I spent a month overdue on my next dose. I was chronically sick.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meals were bare bones, but technically they ticked all the boxes to be considered acceptable. I stole extra food whenever I could. We were allowed to list three foods we didn’t like that wouldn’t be served. Don’t like eggs? Too bad. You had to specify what kind of eggs you hated. The meat was boiled. Nothing tasted good. No extra portions for growing kids. We all got the same amount. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was no privacy. Every morning, you had to stand up, say your name, and the reason you were in there to begin with to all the other kids. The lights in the halls were always on and buzzing. We all had one blanket each, which was thin. The staff checked every room every few hours, shining a flashlight in briefly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The facility was so overstaffed that to handle the sheer amount of patients, certain protocols were implemented, and others were abandoned entirely. Punishments were incredibly severe. When I made a joke about one of the absurd rules, I was sent to my room for four hours, and was not allowed to speak to anyone. I spoke to my roommate, of course. Everyone who laughed at my joke was given the same punishment. They resorted to the “Quiet Room” as their go-to punishment eventually. This was what gave me PTSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any kid who didn’t comply with the rules, i.e. arguing, refusing to cooperate, swearing, or otherwise disobeying authority (though not hurting anyone), had security called on them. There were usually two security guards (at least, that’s what they looked like, I don’t know if they were police or something else) who came. No one bothered to shuffle us into our rooms during the process. We got front row seats to watch a child scream and cry as one guard held them in place, usually from behind, and another one injected them with something. I remember it going in the neck. It usually took a minute or two, but the kid would then be dragged--lifelessly or kicking and screaming--into the Quiet Room, which was permanently dark. Its door was made of steel. It had one window, which was round and curved out like a submarine’s. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don’t look at the kid. Don’t speak to the kid. Don’t acknowledge the kid. Absolutely don’t tell the staff what they were doing was cruel. Do any of this, and you’ll be next. They stayed in there for a few days. Their only interaction was when a staff member shoved a tray of food in. They all pounded on the window, begging to be let out, shrieking that “You can’t do this to us! We’re human beings! Let me out! Let me out!” \n",
      "\n",
      "Child after child after child went in. The Quiet Room was very rarely empty. When it was, I was taken there to use the bathroom since my roommate was using mine. It looked straight out of a 1920s asylum. Cold, dark, cracked walls and floor. Only a blue mat in place of a bed. No blanket. No stimulation. Just a makeshift bunker that literal children were thrown into. I completely broke down after that. I begged my parents to take me home. I bribed the staff. I cried all day, every day. I explained why it was detrimental to my health, physical and mental, to keep me here. I used my words, I used logic, I used everything I could. I attended every meeting. I took the meds. I was a model prisoner. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only reason I left after one month was to go to a residential treatment center, where I stayed for nine months. The psychiatrist of that place was my general psychiatrist, so he saw my name on the list and rocketed me to the front. Otherwise, I would’ve been there longer. I remember seeing that long term facility’s “quiet room” and completely breaking down. The staff found me in a ball on the floor holding my head and screaming. \n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary**: I understand the OP’s post. Technically, they are right. That is how you best get out of there. You suppress your meltdowns. You take the medications. You put on a happy face. You act like a good neurotypical. And then you get out. Except for when you don’t. The problem for this advice is that **it shouldn’t have to exist in the first place**. The fact that this advice is even applicable to psych wards is exactly what is wrong with the healthcare system. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why should we have to torture ourselves to the extent of PTSD to **possibly** get out of there? Why are these places structured and staffed in a way that’ll give us PTSD in the first place? Why should we be treated as basket cases rather than people? In places like these, no advice can spare you from pain. You’re not designed to get better there. You’re designed to be dampened to a non-threat. Even if you’re to follow the OP’s advice, there’s no guarantee it’ll work. Here’s my advice to you:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Don’t take medication that compromises your health.** If you get sick, the ward doesn't care. They won’t help you. Keep yourself in as best health as you can. **Take as much food as you can.** Those portable packets of peanut butter? Stuff them into your pockets. Hide them in your room. In my ward, juice during snack time was unlimited. Drink it. **If you have to lie, be convincing.** Don’t say your day was great if you spent most of it crying. You want to appear somewhat okay, but they’ll know when you tell a bad lie. **If you can, reach out to your friends or loved ones.** Or make some. You’ll want one person you can spill your guts to. Preferably *not* a member of staff. **Assess your situation.** Is it understaffed? Are you allowed electronics? Can you go outside or talk with friends?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m 22 now. My PTSD is no longer debilitating, but I still have nightmares of being back there. I no longer trust medical staff. I live in fear that if I reach out to a suicide helpline, I’ll be thrown in a similar place. My trust in people who are supposed to help me is shattered. I’m paranoid, alone, and too afraid to seek proper treatment for myself due to my experiences in a psych ward. I’m heavily suicidal. I self harm. I starve myself. I refuse to get help for it in case it lands me in those hellscapes. My safety is constantly in danger because of a place that was supposed to help me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Things need to change. OP’s post had good intentions, and as much as I hate to admit it, they’re right in everything they said when it pertains to getting out of there. But whether you take their advice or not, psych wards will compromise your health. I’m so angry that I and other kids went through that torture. I stayed quiet because I thought no one would believe me, let alone care. The insane asylums we marvel at with horror today have hardly changed. \n",
      "\n",
      "We need more individualized care, better pay for those who work in these positions, proper accommodations and advocacy for those in care, better training for staff, but most importantly, **disabled and mentally ill people need to be seen as people first and foremost.** Not burdens on our tax dollars, not crazy stereotypes, not lunatics waiting to snap, not statistics, not intellectually deficient morons, but people. Social change is the key. \n",
      "\n",
      "I lived a nightmare where I was treated like an animal. I watched my fellow patients snap. I watched their hope die out. I watched a suicide attempt while in the ward. It was like seeing people die. They beat us all down until we were next in line to release. Psych wards do not inspire joy and healing. They're a result of greed and humiliation for the abnormal of society. Your humanity is stripped from you. Maybe mine was exceptionally bad, but I honestly don't think so. We weren't beaten, after all. Just subdued. Abuse of all kinds is rampant through these places. The only way this changes is through social change. Until then, the OP's advice, as cold and compromising as it may be, is the best you would have.\n"
